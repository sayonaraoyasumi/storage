<h3 id="toc_index_1">Introduction: The Day I Fell from the Sky</h3>

<p>The slice of sky visible through the hospital room window was very small. The high summer sun fell along the wall, allowing only the sunset to sneak into the room. A knock on the orange door, and when I looked up, there was Mr. Takayama, his figure faintly tinted by the sunset.</p>

<p>Hair streaked with white, a shirt with embroidery. He said he started “Sky” after retiring, so I guess he's around seventy now. A person high above the clouds, for me, having served as a DJ, columnist, and a record company executive. He praised me, saying, “Even someone as skilled as Terui-kun can have accidents, so the sky is scary.”</p>

<p>“No, I'm still just...”</p>

<p>I started paragliding right after I entered college. Just over three years. And it's been only a month since ex-girlfriend death. I might have been a bit reckless. I wanted to disappear. Unable to put those thoughts into words, “I wonder if it was good for me to be alive, causing trouble for everyone like this...” For the past month, I had been constantly questioning myself, and I inadvertently voiced my thoughts.</p>

<p>“I'm truly relieved that you're safe, Terui-kun.”</p>

<p>Mr. Takayama exaggerated a bit and said, “Terui-kun, there's a story like this,” and snapped his fingers.</p>

<p>He told me the story of a rock musician who made a comeback from a serious injury. A drummer who lost his left arm in an accident, a guitarist who suffered a complex fracture after falling off the stage, and a vocalist who underwent a major bone transplant due to a bicycle accident – I recognized the name “U2” that came up third.</p>

<p>“You might not know the first two because of your youth, Terui-kun, but both are great musicians who left their names in rock history.”</p>

<p>I somehow managed to return a smile, “But I think I might quit the sky.” I said it without thinking, but Mr. Takayama's smile didn't fade.</p>

<p>“Is that so? That's a shame. But if you need advice, I'm here for you.”</p>

<p>All I could do was return a forced smile to those words.</p>

<p>I think the accident was the day before yesterday. I didn't have any flight plans, but I wanted to fill the emptiness in my chest, so I rode the faint wind at the foot of Mount Fuji. But the wind didn't even give me a piece of exhilaration and quietly blew away.</p>

<p>As I quietly lowered my altitude, I still felt like I could find the wind somewhere. If I could fly just a hundred meters... no, just ten meters further, I could catch the rising air current again. While reaching for the distant clouds, I realized my lines touched the tree branches, and I don't remember anything after that.</p>

<p>“First, you need to heal your injuries. Don't rush.”</p>

<p>“That's true. But...” Even if my injuries heal... “The most important person to me is gone.” How should I live from now on? Holding back tears at the tip of my nose, Mr. Takayama nodded slowly and opened his mouth.</p>

<p>“There is no purpose in life. There are only results. You just have to be alive.”</p>

<p>I took those softly spun words in both hands. “Please live for the sake of the girl who passed away, Terui-kun.” Mr. Takayama said that, but for me now, that was too painful.</p>

<p>I hadn't seen her for three years. To be honest, during that time, I had two heartbreaks and almost forgot about her.</p>

<p>“When I returned to my apartment that day, the door was unlocked.” It was an event from a month ago, and I felt like I could talk about it now. “Even when I saw the small sneakers lined up, I thought it was just someone's prank. I heard the sound of water in the shower room, and I wondered who had sneaked in. I decided to scare them back, opened the door, and there she was, collapsed on the blood-stained floor. What kind of expression do you think I had then?”</p>

<p>As I spoke up to that point, tears began to fall. Looking at my face, Mr. Takayama shook his head quietly.</p>

<p>“I was smiling.”</p>

<p>Mr. Takayama gently gathered the shame overflowing from my heart. Swallowing my sadness and frustration, he spoke again.</p>

<p>“But Terui-kun, you'll meet her again in heaven someday, right?”</p>

<p>In heaven...?</p>

<p>“In heaven, you'll meet her again, and talk to her. Why not think about what kind of conversation you can have at that time?”</p>

<p>Mr. Takayama's gentle, quiet voice swayed in the wind from the window.</p>

<p>“What kind of life you lived, what happened. When you tell her about that, wouldn't it be wonderful to say, 'Let's be born again in this world'?”</p>

<p>I...</p>

<p>“Even if you say, 'Life was boring after all, your choice was right,' it doesn't matter. It's up to you, Terui-kun.”</p>

<p>Even though I should have killed my heart...</p>

<p>“Your life from now on is about searching for the words to say to her.”</p>

<p>That night, I cried myself to sleep.</p>
